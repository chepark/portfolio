In the fast-paced world of web development, performance is not just an option;
it's a necessity. Apps must be fast and responsive to keep users active and
engaged. A key aspect of achieving these expectations is to optimize user
interactions and events. Debounce and throttle are techniques that offer
enhanced user experience by reducing unnecessary executions of event handlers
(callback functions).

## Understanding Event Handling in React

Before diving into debounce and throttle, let's first understand a well-known
challenges in React. React applications often need to respond to user actions in
real-time. It could be a situation where a user types in a search box, scrolls
infinitely through a list, or resizes their browser window. Each action of the
user can trigger a cascade of event handlers. Without careful implementation,
these handlers can execute functions more frequently than necessary, leading to
performance bottlenecks and degrading user experiences.

For instance, consider a search bar that fetches results as the user types.
Without optimization, every keystroke would send a http request to the server,
triggering unnecessary load and causing delays in the user interface. Similarly,
handling scroll events without caution can lead to jittery scrolling
experiences.

## Introducing Debounce and Throttle

The solution to these challenges lies in two key concepts: debouncing and
throttling. Both techniques aim to control the frequency of function execution,
but they do so in slightly different ways.

## What is debounce?

Debounce is a method to executes a callback function when a certain period time
is passed after a user event is detected. In other words, it waits for a pause
in the events before executing an event handler. This technique can be
particulary useful for actions like live search. It enable to fetch search
results only when the user has stopped typing, reducing the number of calls to
the server.

## Implementing debounce in React

```jsx
import { memo, useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';

// Custom debounce hook
function useDebounce(callback, delay) {
  const [timer, setTimer] = useState(null);

  // return callback wrapping with setTimeout.
  const debouncedCallback = (...args) => {
    if (!timer) {
      setTimer(setTimeout(() => {
        callback(...args)
      }, delay);)
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    // if a timer already exists, remove it.
    return () => {
      if (timer) clearTimeout(timer);
    };
  }, [timer]);

  return debouncedCallback;
}

// SearchInput: Example component using the useDebounce hook
function SearchInput() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const debouncedSearchRequest = useDebounce(()=>{console.log('fetch search results of', query)}, 500);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (query) {
      debouncedSearchRequest()
    }
  }, [query]);

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={query}
      onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Type to search..."
    />
  );
}

export default memo(SearchInput)
```

## What is throttle?

Throttling, on the other hand, ensures that a function is only executed once
every specified period. Unlike debouncing, which waits for a pause, throttling
will allow the function to execute periodically, ensuring that it's not called
more often than the specified rate. This approach is ideal for handling actions
like scrolling or resizing, where you want to ensure that the event handler is
called at a controlled, steady pace.

## Implementing throttle in React

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useThrottle(callback, delay) {
  const [waiting, setWaiting] = useState('false');

  const throttleCallback = (..args) => {
    if (waiting) return;

    callback(...args);
    setWaiting(true);
    const id = setTimeout(()=>{
      setWaiting(false);
    }, delay)
  };

  return throttleCallback;
}

function ResizeListner() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  const handleResize = useThrottle(()=>{
    setWidth(window.innerWidth)
  }, 1000)

  useEffect(()=>{
    window.addEventListners('resize', handleResize);

    return ()=> window.removeEventListner('resize', handleResize);
  }, [handleResize])

  return <p>inner width: {width}</p>
}
```

## When to use Debounce vs. Throttle

**Debounce** is your go-to when you need to ensure that a function is executed
only after a certain amount of idle time has passed since the last invocation.
This makes it ideal for handling events that don't require immediate feedback
for every action. Common use cases include:

- Validating text inputs or search fields as the user types.
- Applying filters based on user input.
- Autosaving functionality that triggers after typing pauses.

**Throttle**, on the other hand, ensures that a function is called at most once
in a specified time frame. Use throttle when you want to maintain regular
execution intervals for actions that occur frequently. Typical scenarios
include:

- Tracking scroll positions to trigger animations or loading.
- Resizing handlers for dynamic layout adjustments.

## Mistsakes must be avoided

- Overuse: Applying debounce or throttle universally without considering the
  nature of the event can lead to sluggish interfaces or missed user inputs.
  Assess the necessity on a case-by-case basis.

- Incorrect Implementation: Mixing up debounce and throttle logic, or setting
  inappropriate timings, can degrade the user experience. Ensure you're using
  the right technique for the right scenario.

- Memory Leaks: Not cleaning up event listeners or timeouts/intervals can lead
  to memory leaks, especially in Single Page Applications. Always provide
  cleanup functions in your useEffect hooks.

## Advanced Topics

Other Performance Optimization Techniques in React Memoization: Use React's
`React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders by
memoizing components and functions. This is especially beneficial for components
that receive complex objects as props or rely on computationally expensive
calculations.

Lazy Loading: React's `React.lazy` and `Suspense` let you split your component
code into separate chunks that are loaded only when needed. This can
significantly reduce the initial load time of your app, making it feel snappier.

Virtualization: For lists or grids displaying a large amount of data, consider
using windowing or virtualization libraries like `react-window` or
`react-virtualized`. These libraries render only the items currently visible to
the user, reducing the number of DOM nodes and improving performance.
