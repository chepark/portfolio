In the fast-paced world of web development, performance is not just an option;
it's a necessity. Apps must be fast and responsive to keep users active and
engaged. A key aspect of achieving these expectations is to optimize user
interactions and events. Debounce and throttle are techniques that offer
enhanced user experience by reducing unnecessary executions of event handlers
(callback functions).

## Understanding Event Handling in React

Before diving into debounce and throttle, let's first understand a well-known
challenges in React. React applications often need to respond to user actions in
real-time. It could be a situation where a user types in a search box, scrolls
infinitely through a list, or resizes their browser window. Each action of the
user can trigger a cascade of event handlers. Without careful implementation,
these handlers can execute functions more frequently than necessary, leading to
performance bottlenecks and degrading user experiences.

For instance, consider a search bar that fetches results as the user types.
Without optimization, every keystroke would send a http request to the server,
triggering unnecessary load and causing delays in the user interface. Similarly,
handling scroll events without caution can lead to jittery scrolling
experiences.

## Introducing Debounce and Throttle

The solution to these challenges lies in two key concepts: debouncing and
throttling. Both techniques aim to control the frequency of function execution,
but they do so in slightly different ways.

## What is debounce?

Debounce is a method to executes a callback function when a certain period time
is passed after a user event is detected. In other words, it waits for a pause
in the events before executing an event handler. This technique can be
particulary useful for actions like live search. It enable to fetch search
results only when the user has stopped typing, reducing the number of calls to
the server.

## Implementing debounce in React

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Custom debounce hook
function useDebounce(value, delay) {
  // State and setters for debounced value
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Set debouncedValue to value (passed in) after the specified delay
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    // Cleanup function to cancel the timeout if value or delay changes
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [value, delay]); // Only re-call effect if value or delay changes

  return debouncedValue;
}

// Example component using the useDebounce hook
function SearchInput() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(text, 500);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (debouncedSearchTerm) {
      // Perform the search or action using the debouncedSearchTerm
      console.log(debouncedSearchTerm);
    }
  }, [debouncedSearchTerm]);

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={text}
      onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Type to search..."
    />
  );
}
```

## What is throttle?

Throttling, on the other hand, ensures that a function is only executed once
every specified period. Unlike debouncing, which waits for a pause, throttling
will allow the function to execute periodically, ensuring that it's not called
more often than the specified rate. This approach is ideal for handling actions
like scrolling or resizing, where you want to ensure that the event handler is
called at a controlled, steady pace.
