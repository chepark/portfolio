excerpt: You will learn how to setup development environment with Webpack for TypeScript frontend projects.
---

I started to learn TypeScript by building a simple frontend project but it was
challenging from the very beginning when I setup the development environment.

The reasons are, first of all, I didn't have prior knowledge in bundling, Webpack,
and any other build tools. Plus, it was hard to find right tutorials or resources for
TypeScript frontend projects (without React) that actually work.

After several days of research and experiement, I understand how Webpack works
and how to setup development environment for TypeScript frontend projects.
I write down this article to help people just like me who ...

1. wants to build a typescript project with TypeScript (No React).
2. wants to know about basics of how Webpack works.
3. wants to learn about development environment setup for TypeScript frontend project.

## 1. What is Webpack and how does it work?

Webpack is a module bundler. Its main job is to bundle JavaScript files to use
in a browser. Also, Webpack transforms front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and
images if loaders are included.

## Final directory and file structure

```
myApp/
├─ dist/
│ ├─ index.html
│ ├─ bundle.js
├─ src/
│ ├─ index.html
│ ├─ index.ts
│ ├─ styles.css
├─ node_modules/
├─ package-lock.json
├─ package.json
├─ postcss.config.js
├─ tailwindcss.config.js
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ webpack.config.js
```

## Packages

The following packages are needed for our project.

-

## loaders, plugins in Webpack

## 1. Initialize the project

Create a directory with the name of `myApp` and got to the project directory.

```
mkdir myApp
cd myApp
```

With the following command line, create a `package.json`.

```
npm init -y
```

## 2. Setup to bundle .ts files.

### 2-1. Install necessary packages to bundle TypeScript.

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli typescript ts-loader -D
```

You will see that `node_modules` is created and `ts-loader`, `typescript`,
`webpack`, and `webpack-cli` are now in the `devDependencies` property in
`package.json`

### 2-2. Create /src/index.ts

Create both `src` directory and `index.ts` in the project folder.

```
myApp/
├─ src/
│ ├─ index.ts
├─ node_modules/
├─ package-lock.json
├─ package.json

```

### 2-3. Create webpack.config.js and setup

### 2-4. Create tsconfig.json and setup

### 2-5. Add npm script: start and buildin

### 2-6. Start to build to test out

![npm run build](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4e1d3b6d-c78e-4861-ba95-a338b4130596/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20221116%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221116T121640Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=e0ade733bdda1b9b2cc164444785b0e8916f7bf7479780dba5e16bf6cd1934d4&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%3D%22Untitled.png%22&x-id=GetObject)
