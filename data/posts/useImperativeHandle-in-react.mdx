  useImperativeHandle is not a very popular hook in React. But it is very useful
  when you want to expose some imperative methods to the parent component.

Today, we're going to explore one of its lesser-known hooks in React:
`useImperativeHandle`. By the end of this blog post, you'll not only understand
what this hook does but also why it's crucial and how you can wield its power in
your web apps. So, let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on our journey, let's make sure we're on the same page. To
grasp the concept of useImperativeHandle, you should have a good understanding
of the following:

- **React Basics**: Familiarity with React components, state, props, and hooks
  is essential. If you're not comfortable with these concepts yet, consider
  checking out React's official documentation or some beginner-friendly
  tutorials.

- **useRef**: A basic understanding of the useRef hook will come in handy, as
  useImperativeHandle often works in conjunction with it.

- **forwardRef**: forwardRef is a React API that allows you to pass a ref to a
  child component. It is used in conjunction with `ref` and
  `useImperativeHandle`.

## What is `useImperativeHandle`?

In React, components can communicate with each other through props, context, and
other mechanisms. However, there are situations where you might want to expose a
component's internal methods or state to its parent component or external
world.This is where `useImperativeHandle shines.

It might be a bit confusing at first, but don't worry. I dissect the name of the
hook into two to understand the concept thoroughly: 'imperative' and 'handle'.
Do you know what they are?

### imperative vs declarative programming

Imperative and declrative programming are two major programming paradigms. In
imperative programming, the focus is on describing the sequence of steps or
commands that the computer must perform to achieve a particular result.

In contrast, declarative programming emphasizes describing what you want to
achieve without specifying the exact step-by-step process. It focuses on the
"what" rather than the "how." React itself is often considered a declarative
library, especially when you work with JSX and declaratively define the UI based
on state.

The term "imperative" in `useImperativeHandle` implies that this hook allows you
to introduce a level of imperative-style programming within a declarative React
component. It allows you to handle certain aspects of a component's behavior in
a more imperative, step-by-step manner while still being part of the overall
declarative React ecosystem.

### handle

The 'handle' is an object that encapsulates certain functionality or
information. It's exposed via a ref, and useImperativeHandle allows you to
fine-tune what exactly is made accessible through that ref. This mechanism is
particularly useful when you want to provide controlled access to a component's
internal functionality without exposing all of its implementation details.

```jsx
useImperativeHandle(
  ref,
  () => {
    return {
      // ... this is the handle having methods, and  data ...
      // ... that you want to expose to the parent component ...
    };
  },
  [],
);
```

## Why is it needed?

You might be wondering why we need a hook like `useImperativeHandle` when we
already have props and context for communication. Well, here are a few scenarios
that I personally think `useImperativeHandle` can be in handy:

1. **Ref Forwarding**: Sometimes, you want to forward a ref from a child
   component to the parent or a higher-level component, enabling parent
   components to interact with child component methods directly.

2. **Abstraction**: It helps abstract away the internal implementation details
   of a component. This can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code since the
   parent component doesn't need to know the inner workings of its children.

## How to use `useImperativeHandle`?

Import `useImperativHandle` and `forwardRef` from React. Then create a child
component passing `ref` as a second argument to `forwardRef` function. Call
`useImperativeHandle` to customize what you want to expose to the parent
component.

```jsx
import { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';

const MyChild = forwardRef(function MyChild(props, ref) {
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {
    return {
      // ...methods, or data that you want to expose to the parent ...
    };
  }, []);
```

## Play around with `useImperativeHandle`.

Lets make a simple game using `useImperativeHandle`. When a user clicks on
"Answer the question" button, one of the inputs next to question will be
randomly focused.
[Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-examples-ngqhnq?file=/src/UseImperativeHandle/Form.tsx)

1.  Create FormInput component using `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle`.

```jsx
import { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle, useRef, Ref } from "react";

export interface RefType {
  focusName: () => void;
  focusSchool: () => void;
  focusHello: () => void;
}

const FormInput = forwardRef<RefType>(function FormInput(props, ref) {
  const sectionRef = useRef<(HTMLInputElement | null)[]>([]);

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {
    // Expose methods to the parent component
    // each method will focus on the input field next to question
    return {
      // It will focus on the input field next to "What is your name?"
      focusName() {
        console.log(sectionRef);
        sectionRef?.current[0]?.focus();
      },
      // It will focus on the input field next to "What is your school?"
      focusSchool() {
        sectionRef?.current[1]?.focus();
      },
      // It will focus on the input field next to "Say hello!"
      focusHello() {
        sectionRef?.current[2]?.focus();
      }
    };
  });

// Create three input fields with questions
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <label>
          What is your name?:
          <input ref={(el) => (sectionRef.current[0] = el)} />
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          What is your school:
          <input ref={(el) => (sectionRef.current[1] = el)} />
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          Say hello!:
          <input ref={(el) => (sectionRef.current[2] = el)} />
        </label>
      </div>
    </>
  );
});

export default FormInput;

```

2. Create a Form component (parent of FormInput component) and pass a ref to the
   child component.

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from "react";
import FormInput, { RefType } from "./FormInput";

export default function Form() {
  const myRef = useRef<RefType>(null);

  const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (myRef && myRef.current) {
      // Get all methods names as an array: [focusName, focusSchool, focusHello]
      const keys = Object.keys(myRef.current);
      // Get a random number between 0 and 2
      const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
      // Choose a method name randomly
      const selectedFunc = keys[randomNumber];
      // Call the selected method
      myRef.current[selectedFunc as keyof RefType]();
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <form>
        <FormInput ref={myRef} />
        <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Answer the question</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}

```

## Usecases

I think `useImperativeHandle` can be useful especially in these two scenarioss:

1. **Video Player Component** Imagine you're building a video player component.
   With useImperativeHandle, you can expose methods like play, pause, and seek
   to control the video playback externally, giving you more flexibility in how
   you integrate and control the component in your app.

2. **Custom Input Field** Let's say you're creating a custom input field
   component. You can use useImperativeHandle to expose methods like focus or
   clear to control the input's behavior programmatically.

## Pitfalls

According to React offical documentation, `useImperativeHandle` should not be
overused. It is recommended to use them only when you cannot achieve your goal
with props. Scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation,
selecting text are some examples of good use cases for `useImperativeHandle`.
