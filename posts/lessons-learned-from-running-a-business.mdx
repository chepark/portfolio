<p>
  Over the past two years, I have operated a wholesale E-commerce store to sell
  European vintages to South Korean retailers. While running the business,
  everyday was dynamic. It was fun but also demanding. There have been
  challenges that I couldn't solve and the followings are the lessons that I
  learned from my previous business.

# Lessons regarding running a business

<p>
  The major premise: A company should make profits by selling products or
  services.
</p>

## Market size matters.

Market size is important. Small market means that there is a limit to generate
profits and to gain new customers. Of course, [creating a market]("https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/what-does-it-take-to-create-market") can be another option but it takes time to convince customers, partners, and
other constituencies to see the world differently.

<p>
  I do not have an answer about how big a market should be to be in. However,
  one thing that I am sure is that I will research and measure the estimate of
  the market size before making a decision to enter the market.

## Economies of Scale

[Economies of scale]("https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp") means cost advantage that companies would get when production becomes efficient.
In a company where production lines are systematized, the cost of time and money
should decrease as customers and orders increase. Unfortunately, my business has
performed in opposite direction. The more orders were made, the more time and money
were consumed. A rise of the cost was inevitable considering the following features
of vintage ceramics.

- Ceramics are fragile.

  <p>
    Ceramics are easy to be damaged during transport. The risks to have damages
    are higher in international shipping. In order to prevent any harms, packing
    materials should be sturdy and it costs more money. (Cost &#8593;). Besides,
    all items should be covered carefully with packing foam and it takes time
    (Time &#8593;).
  </p>

- The size and volumes vary in each item.

  <p>
    Since the size and volumes of vintage ceramics are not standardized, it is
    necessary to customize the box sizes. Purchasing various sizes of packing
    boxes with small amount costs more.(Cost &#8593;) Sometimes, I need to make
    a box where items were perfectly fit into. (Time &#8593;)
  </p>

- I cannot control quantity and quality of products.
  <p>
    The major drawback of selling vintage ceramics is in the quality and
    quantity control. Vintage are not new. They are used and it is easy to find
    defects on items. Even though I sourced items after thoroughly checking
    conditions, there were always minor defects. My customers avoided to buying
    these items and the items with defects remained as unsold stocks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, manufacturers do not exist for vintage. It is hard to restore products
    stably and continuously if there are popular items. I need to constantly
    look for new items that can be sold. (Time &#8593;)

## Uniqueness of products or services

## Products or services should be legitimate.
